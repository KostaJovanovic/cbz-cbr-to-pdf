## How to run

- Batch converts all comics found in dropped folders
- Skips files that already have a matching PDF
- Outputs all PDFs to a `Converted PDFs` folder next to the source files

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **7-Zip** installed at `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe`

### Python packages

pip install img2pdf windnd
```

## How it works

1. Extracts the comic archive using 7-Zip (CBR = RAR, CBZ = ZIP)
2. Collects all image files (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, WebP) sorted by name
3. Combines them into a multi-page PDF using `img2pdf`
4. Cleans up temporary extracted files
